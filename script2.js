// Create variables for operations called a, b, result and operator

// Create functions for basic operations called add, substract, multiply and divide

// Create function for calling appropriate operations called operate that return result
    // If (a,b or operator are undefined), return ERROR
    // If (b = 0 and operator = '/'), return ERROR
    // Else return result based on appropriate operation

// Get input from user

    // If input is a number and a or operator are not defined yet, store it in a
        // Otherwise store input into b

    // If input is an operator, and operator is undefined, store operator value in operator
        
        // If (a and operator) are defined or if a is undefined, do nothing
        // Else if (a, b and operator) are defined, perform function operate and store result in a

    // If input is equal sign, perform operate function based on a, b and operator
